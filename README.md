hello guys i am doing a project known as bank term deposit prediction using ML. 
The project is a good example of the evaluation of a marketing campaign and how to implement a tool to predict the behavior.
The data was treated since there are columns that are not congruent with the study, such as the target that has 4 parameters of which were transformed to 2 to be able to carry out the model.
Target data, not really knowing each category, decided to only use the success category as the acceptance category for the campaign and the rest of the categories are considered rejections.
The two model used to create the tool was enought to has a good result according with the data share with a error around 0.2.
